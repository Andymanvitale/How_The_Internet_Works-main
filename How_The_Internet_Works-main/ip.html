  <h2>IP Addresses, Packets, and Routing</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
  <p>Internet Protocol, or IP is the simple way that computers and networks communicate with one another to send data. Each computer has a unique address
  which can be used to send and receive data. IPv4 was developed in 1973 and it provides over 4 billion unique addresses to networks across the world. That
    number seems like a lot however as the internet continues to expand, all 4 billion will eventually be taken up and there will be no more unique addresses
    available. Each IPv4 is 32 bits long and is broken down into 4 sections. Each IP address follows the format of W.X.Y.Z and each letter represents 8 bits.</p>
  <p>In order to solve the issue of running out of unique addresses, IPv6 was developed. It follows a 128 bit format and will be able to produce over
  340 undecillion unique addresses. The more accurate number of unique addresses is 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Having that many
  unique addresses was compared to one address per grain of sand on the Earth. Wikipedia has a breakdown of how the naming of IPv6 works.</p>

  <h3>Packets</h3>
  <p>Sending a full image across the internet can consume a lot of resources and slow down load speeds. In order to fix that, data is broken down into packets
    and is sent across networks until it arrives at the recipient.  Since the data is being broken into pieces, by itself there is no way that we know if we
    received it all without analyzing all of it. That's why the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, was developed. It's duty is to read incoming
    messages and ensure that it is fully received and assembled correctly. If it isn't it sends back a signal to the sender and it will be resent. </p>
  <p>Breaking down large chunks of data into packets is an amazing idea and it has a failsafe to ensure it is being done correctly. The data is broken
  down into binary and takes up much less resources. These packets are restricted to 64K or 65535 bytes. Sending multiple packets of this size can ensure
  they are arriving as fast as possible, and due to their independence from one another, they can travel on the most efficient route to the recipient.
  Data is limited by the capabilities of the hardware it is travelling through. The bandwidth measures the number of bits that can be handled by the
  network and is measured in bits per second. Latency measures how long it takes for a bit to travel from sender to receiver. Each of these play into how fast
  data can be transmitted from a sender to a receiver.</p>

  <h3>Routing</h3>
  <p>Routing is the basic way of saying the path that a packet of information will take as it goes from the sender to the recipient. As it travels, the signal
  takes different paths to ensure it arrives at it's destination as fast as possible and as 'cheap' as possible. There are multiple ways that this data gets
  sent. One way is by light using fiber optic cables. These cables are expensive to manufacture and hard to work with, but they are reliable and have barely any
  signal loss over long distances. Another way that a packet can travel is by using electricity, where a signal travels through a wire or cable. A third way
  that a signal can travel is through radio waves. Data is translated into radio waves and is sent over a wireless connection. This data is not reliable over
  long distances and is generally used for situations like WiFi. Putting it all together, we can interact with all of these types of connections at once. We could
  be on our phones uploading a message to a website. That signal would travel over WiFi to a router, where it will travel over an electrical signal through
  multiple networks and eventually reach a fiber optic cable. That cable runs through the ocean to another country where it follows the same process backward
  and someone will be able to see it.</p>
